# Spatial Data Engineering for Urban Environments

This repository contains a set of four interconnected projects demonstrating spatial data engineering workflows using Python, PostGIS, and web-ready outputs.

## Project Structure

1. **vector:** Urban Infrastructure Density (vector ETL)
2. **raster:** NDVI and NDBI Composite Generation (raster ETL)
3. **zonal_stats:** District-Level Zonal Statistics (vector-raster analytics)
4. **updates:** Multi-Year NDVI Update Pipeline (incremental updates)

## Technology Overview

Python is used for data processing, PostGIS for spatial computation, and Leaflet for visualisation.

## Repository Layout

See individual project folders for further documentation, including the execution instructions.
