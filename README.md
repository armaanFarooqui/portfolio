# Spatial Computing Projects

This repository contains three independent projects demonstrating computer vision, supervised machine learning, and PostGIS-based spatial analytics workflows.

Each project is implemented as a reproducible pipeline using Python and open geospatial tools.


## Project Structure

1. **field_boundary_detection:** Edge-based segmentation of agricultural parcels (raster to vector workflow)
2. **random_forest_lulc:** Supervised land-cover classification using Random Forest
3. **urban_infrastructure_density:** District-level infrastructure metrics using Python + PostGIS



## Technology Overview

Python is used for data processing and modelling, PostGIS for spatial database computation, and GeoJSON outputs are prepared for web-based visualisation.

Core libraries include: GeoPandas, Rasterio, OpenCV, scikit-learn, OSMnx, and SQLAlchemy.


## Documentation

See individual project folders for further documentation.
